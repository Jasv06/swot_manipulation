- The **Place.h** file which will help you make the robot pick an object from a predetermined position, check whether your hand is stable or not and then drop the object in it. 
- The **Poses.h** file which will help you make the robot pick multiple objects from different positions showing the different ways the reactor-x 150 can pick up objects and follow your hand until it is stable and drop the object/objects.
